# Jonathan Yin

:wave: Hey there! I'm Jonathan. My interests broadly lie at the intersection of AI, data science, and software development.

Previously, I studied computer science and statistics at Yale. I worked on [Benchling](https://www.benchling.com/)'s Electronic Lab Notebook product, deep learning for drug discovery at [Octant](https://www.octant.bio/), and researched machine learning models for molecular representation at the [Broad Institute](https://www.broadinstitute.org/).

In my free time, I enjoy flying drones, staying active, and attending music festivals.
