:wave: Hey! I'm an undergrad at Yale studying Computer Science and Statistics. My interests broadly lie at the intersection of machine learning, data science, and software development.

This past summer, I interned at [Benchling](https://www.benchling.com/), building out chemistry support in the Electronic Lab Notebook (ELN) product.
Previously, I've also worked on deep learning for drug discovery at [Octant](https://www.octant.bio/), researched machine learning models for molecular representation at the [Broad Institute](https://www.broadinstitute.org/), and developed frontend at [Beagle Learning](https://en.beaglelearning.com/).

In my free time, I enjoy flying drones, staying active, and listening to music.
