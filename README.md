:wave: Hey! I'm an undergrad at Yale studying Computer Science and Statistics. My interests broadly lie at the intersection of machine learning, data science, and software development.

In the past, I've worked on deep learning for drug discovery at [Octant](https://www.octant.bio/) and frontend engineering at [Beagle Learning](https://en.beaglelearning.com/). I've also researched ML models for molecular representation at the [Broad Institute](https://www.broadinstitute.org/).

In my free time, I enjoy flying drones, exercising, and listening to music.
