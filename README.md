# Jonathan Yin

:wave: Hey! I'm an undergrad at Yale studying Computer Science and Statistics. My interests broadly lie at the intersection of machine learning, data science, and software development. This summer, I'll be interning at [Benchling](https://www.benchling.com/) as a software engineer.

In the past, I've worked on deep learning for drug discovery at [Octant](https://www.octant.bio/) and frontend engineering at [Beagle Learning](https://en.beaglelearning.com/). I've also researched ML models for molecular representation at the [Broad Institute](https://www.broadinstitute.org/).

In my free time, I enjoy flying drones, exercising, and listening to music.
