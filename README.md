:wave: Hey! I'm a senior at Yale studying Computer Science and Statistics. My interests broadly lie at the intersection of machine learning, data science, and software development.

Previously, I worked at [Benchling](https://www.benchling.com/), building out [chemistry support](https://help.benchling.com/hc/en-us/articles/9789080967309-Release-Notes-Volume-10-2022\#h_0721284568) in the Electronic Lab Notebook (ELN) product. I've also worked on deep learning for drug discovery at [Octant](https://www.octant.bio/), researched machine learning models for molecular representation at the [Broad Institute](https://www.broadinstitute.org/), and developed frontend at [Beagle Learning](https://en.beaglelearning.com/).

In my free time, I enjoy flying drones, hiking, and attending music festivals.
